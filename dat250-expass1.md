* technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them:
      Since it was my first time using java and its IDEs, I had problems with the enviroment variables. I didn't understand how they worked, how to edit or where to find them. 
      After asking a friend of mine that works in java, I understood how it worked. 
      Understanding syntax was also a small barrier that I quickly got used to.
* how you have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working
    I followed the hello world introduction within eclipse
* technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform and how you solved them
  I struggled with installing the optional provision add-ons. I installed the necessary software but forgot to restart the cmd.
