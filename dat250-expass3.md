# installing and using MongoDB
I had some minor issues like finding the local user and could not find a user group but other than that, it went fine.
Solved local user by using the name of the account of my pc and password, and I solved user group by adding the user group manually.

# Screenshots

here is an imgur album of all screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/fwLSFGR, each should have an description of what they include

# Experiment 2 implementation

I made a query to see how many items each of them had. This could be useful for stock purposes or see how many items they sell in a given timeframe.

# Pending issues

None. Although I did want to create something a bit more advanced on my own experiment, I couldn't get the correct additions and ended up either getting all of the items or the total price of all items * number of items which obviously isn't correct. Need to find a way to add the two prices together in a seperate way to the counter or quantity
