# Issues I encountered

I only had one issue where the try{} catch on doWork() was catching an exception which made it not receive messages as intended. Following the tutorial past that point (even though it said to test the program) fixed the issue.

Since it's an evolving tutorial kind of, I am posting the different commits that finished the different stages.
