# Technical problems

I didn't really have any major issues in this assignment. Some minor issues where I didn't know how to stop the server.
Because of this, I got 404 on todos because it wasn't updated. Restarting solved it though and it is now updated.

EDIT: 21.nov:

I have now updated the assignment based on the feedback that was provided.

At first I managed to create elements, but they all came out as null. Secondly this also meant they didn't have an ID.

To solve this I decided to use hashmaps and use the hashmap's ID to identify which element I was talking about and properly send in all of the relevant information. 

This worked pretty well and I was able to complete the assignment, and also doing the same to delete even if it wasn't mentioned in the feedback explicitly.
